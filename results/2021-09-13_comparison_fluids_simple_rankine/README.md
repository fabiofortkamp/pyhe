# Comparison between fluids in a simple Rankine cycle.

Consider a simple Rankine cycle (no superheat) between given condenser and boiler temperatures.

How the pressure levels, thermal efficiency and specific work would vary for three fluids: R-134a, R-718 (water), and R-717 (ammonia).

The script `run_experiments.py` analyzes this problem and generates bar plots of specific work, thermal efficiency, condenser pressure and boiler pressure for all fluids.
